This is a "The Odin Project" project wherein we are tasked with the creation of the classic 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' game. The game will be designed solely with the use of javascript. There will be no UI. Also, this program will not make use of loops (even though their use would be beneficial) due to the students not having covered the use of loops thus far.
